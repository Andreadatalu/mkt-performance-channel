The analysis will lead us through the nine provided databases. where we determine which marketing channel performs the best.

### What marketing platforms are employed? 
- Email, Google, Facebook, Instagram, and Whatsapp Business
We must distinguish between paid channels and unpaid channels due to the performance differences between the channels when a budget is involved.

The following channels are regarded as being unpaid: Facebook, Instagram, Google, Email, and Whatsapp Business.
